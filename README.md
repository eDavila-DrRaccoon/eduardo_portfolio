## 👋🏽 About Me
I am Eduardo Dávila Meza, an Engineer, Researcher, and Educator with a Ph.D. in Science in Electrical Engineering, specialized in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Embedded Systems, and ROS. I bridge academic depth with real-world application, solving complex problems in image processing, robotics, and AI-driven systems. Whether developing instance segmentation models for medical imaging or building ROS-based assistive devices, I bring clarity, precision, and efficiency to every layer of the process.

My expertise spans from deep learning models like Mask R-CNN and Swin Transformers to hands-on implementation in C++, Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. I’ve led projects that range from fundus pathology detection in collaboration with German university hospitals, to the creation of OJO SMART, a vision-based assistive technology for visually impaired people, developing ROS nodes for object, color, and text recognition.

In addition to my research, I have co-authored a paper in IEEE Access on low-light color enhancement using quaternion neural networks and co-invented a patent for underactuated control systems. My leadership in the CUValles Technology Development Club resulted in innovative, sustainability-focused embedded system designs, including a patent-pending prototype for wastewater treatment in the tequila industry.

Recognized for my ability to communicate complex ideas, I have served as a professor at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, where I achieved a 96% satisfaction rate teaching ROS and ROS 2 for robotics. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams, value clean and documented code, and always test edge cases.

Fluent in both technical English and Spanish, I’m motivated, self-taught, and passionate about contributing to impactful solutions in roles such as AI/ML Engineer, Computer Vision Specialist, or Robotics and Embedded Systems Developer. I bring research to life through elegant, efficient, and human-centered engineering.
